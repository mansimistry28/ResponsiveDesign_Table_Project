    <p>SD Interiors is a full service residential interior design firm founded by Monicca Dormitzer serving the greater Boston area and beyond. From one room to a whole house,I strive to create beautiful interiors that reflect each client’s lifestyle and tastes.I don’t push you towards one signature look — I want your personality to shine. My designs ensure that your home is comfortable and functional as well as unique and stylish.And I make sure to stay on time and on budget.The design process begins with an initial consultation at your home,free of charge. That way we can get to know each other and see the scope of your project.I also begin to learn what appeals to you and, just as importantly, what does not. Then I bring a range of design solutions to you.I’ll help you discover what look best reflects you and your family. You just may surprise yourself and be drawn to an unexpected furniture piece,rug or textile. My design for each space in your home evolves from there</p>
